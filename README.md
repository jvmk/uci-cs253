# uci-cs253

This repository contains solutions for UCI CS253 homeworks (Fall 2018 edition). Most homework problems are available as exercises in the book "Exercises in Programming Style" by Professor Lopes, but a small subset of the problems are slight variations of said exercises. I have done my best to include problem descriptions (in the code's documentation) whenever a problem is not an immediate 1:1 reference to an exercise in the book. All solutions (except `seven.py`) are written in Java (and assumes Java 8 or newer).

Feel free to use this repository as a reference (e.g., for correctness verification or as an inspiration), but **please do not submit immediate copies of the code provided here as homework solutions for a later edition of UCI CS253** -- you won't learn anything from doing so, and you will most likely get caught.
